I am a data scientist passionate about turning complex datasets into clear, actionable insights. My work spans end‑to‑end ML: framing business questions, building robust pipelines, and communicating results with clarity. I value readable code, sound experimentation, and a product mindset.

I work with **Python**, **SQL**, and the **scikit‑learn** ecosystem, and enjoy building interactive dashboards in **Power BI**. I love data visualization and strive to make analysis approachable for any audience—technical or not.
