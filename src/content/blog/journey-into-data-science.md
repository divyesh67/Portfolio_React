I came to data science through a love of questions. Early projects were scrappy: spreadsheets, ad-hoc SQL, and lots of charts. Over time, I learned to structure problems, measure impact, and communicate findings clearly.

Today, the joy is the same: work with data to create useful change. Whether it's cleaning messy tables or shipping a model to production, I aim for clarity and reliability first.
